################# Setup (if you have not done before) #################
1. Navigate to /home/nicho/catkin_ws/src/open_manipulator_simulations/open_manipulator_gazebo/launch

2. Copy and paste Project1.launch and Project11.launch files here
* See "Gazebo Setup Instructions and Files for OM" folder

3. Navigate to /home/nicho/catkin_ws/src/open_manipulator_simulations/open_manipulator_gazebo/worlds

4. Copy and paste Project1.world file here
* See "Gazebo Setup Instructions and Files for OM" folder


################# Execution Guide #################
1. Launch the Project1 world in Gazebo

$ roslaunch open_manipulator_gazebo Project1.launch

If Project1.launch has errors, try Project11.launch


2. Press play and on another terminal, activate the controller

$ roslaunch open_manipulator_controller open_manipulator_controller.launch use_platform:=false


3. On another terminal, ROSRUN your codes

$ rosrun robotics Project1.py

*ensure that your codes are in the src folder of your robotics package
*ensure you have given permissions to your python files (1. cd to directory; 2. chmod +x your_codes.py)

***Hints: Use control_om.py as a template to build your codes; you will also need to use rospy.sleep() codes in between each step.
