Configuration of Robot Export in bash

Since we are only dealing with TB3 burger, lets configure all exports of the TB3 model to burger. This will help us save time in typing export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger

1. Type in Terminal:

$ gedit ~/.bashrc

2. Scroll all the way down and copy paste “export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger” at the last line.

3. After which, save and exit. Type the command in the terminal:

$ source ~/.bashrc
